    <h3> About the Data <br><br></h3>
    <p> This data was scraped off Carleton's ENROLL tool using a Python web-crawling script. The following variables were collected about each class:</p>
    <p> Department - Which academic department teaches the class <br><br> Class ID Number - The ID code associated with the class, can be used to look it up on the Hub<br><br> Name - The title of the class<br><br> Term - The term during which the course is offered <br><br> Liberal Arts Requirements Fulfilled - These are the graduation requirements that the selected class fulfills <br><br> Class period - The time slot during which the class meets <br><br> Professor - Which professor teaches the class <br><br> Course Description - A description of the course as provided by the department <br></p>
    <h3> Limitations<br><br> </h3>
    <p> While we initially contacted the Registrar's Office in hopes they would give us the data in .csv format, they declined. As a result, we had to use a course catalogue from the previous year. Some data may be outdated. Additionally, we were unable to grab data regarding which teachers were teaching each section of a class. </p>
